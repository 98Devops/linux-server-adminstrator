Part 1: Getting Started with Vagrant and Virtualization Basics

### Introduction to Virtualization

- **Goal**: Understand the concept of virtualization and its benefits.
- **Key Points**: **What is virtualization?** Virtualization allows you to create virtual instances of physical hardware, providing isolated environments for different applications and services on a single physical machine.
- **Benefits of using virtual machines (VMs)**: VMs offer better resource utilization, scalability, and flexibility in development and testing environments.
- **Overview of Vagrant by HashiCorp**: Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtualized development environments. It simplifies the setup process by automating the provisioning of VMs using predefined configurations.

### Setting Up Vagrant

- **Steps**: **Install Vagrant**:
- Download and install Vagrant from the official website. [Vagrant by HashiCorp](https://www.vagrantup.com/?form=MG0AV3)
- **Explanation**: Vagrant provides an easy way to manage and configure virtualized environments. Installing Vagrant is the first step in automating VM setups.
- Vagrant is a command-based tool, so you’ll need a terminal for Windows Users download Git Bash [Git - Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and Mac Users simply use the terminal

bash

```
# Verify Vagrant installation
vagrant --version
```

**Install VirtualBox**:

- Download and install VirtualBox as the virtualization provider. [Downloads – Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- **Explanation**: VirtualBox is a popular virtualization software that works seamlessly with Vagrant. It provides the platform for running VMs

bash

```
# Verify VirtualBox installation
virtualbox --help
```

### Creating a Vagrant Project

**Steps**: **Create a Project Directory**: **Explanation**: Organizing your project in a dedicated directory keeps all related files in one place.

bash

```
mkdir vagrant_project
cd vagrant_project
```

**Initialize a Vagrantfile**:

Explanation: The *vagrant init* command creates a Vagrantfile in your *project directory*. This file contains the configuration for your VM, *ONLY RUN THESE VAGRANT COMMANDS IN THE CREATED DIRECTORY or It won’t work so always check the directory you are running the commands.*

- You also need the Vagrant box or image name for the VM from [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover)

**Vagrant boxes** are pre-configured virtual machine images that can be used with Vagrant to quickly set up and manage virtual environments. They contain a base operating system, and any additional software or configurations needed for a specific use case1.

### How Vagrant Boxes are Useful in Automating VM Environments:

1. **Consistency**: Vagrant boxes ensure that every developer working on a project has the same environment, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem.
2. **Speed**: Setting up a new VM environment is fast because you only need to download and configure the box.
3. **Portability**: Vagrant boxes can be easily shared and reused across different projects and teams.
4. **Automation**: Vagrant integrates with automation tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef to automate the provisioning and configuration of VMs.
5. **Simplicity**: With a simple Vagrantfile, you can define the configuration of your VMs, making it easy to replicate environments.
- vagrant init (command) plus the box name (ubuntu/jammy64) choose from a wide variety of OS And images at [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover)

```
vagrant init ubuntu/jammy64
```

**Edit the Vagrantfile**:

After running the *vagrant init* (command) plus the box name *(ubuntu/jammy64*), if you type the command *ls (*to list content in a directory) There will be a created Vagrantfile pulled from the  [HashiCorp Cloud Platform](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover) 

- Open the `Vagrantfile` with your preferred text editor. (vim, nano)
- **Explanation**: Configuring the Vagrantfile allows you to specify the VM settings such as the operating system, network configuration, and resource allocation.
- Example of what the Vagrantfile looks like.

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"
end
```

- **Key Points**: **What is a Vagrantfile?**: A Vagrantfile is a Ruby script that defines the configuration and provisioning of your virtual environment.
- **Basic structure and purpose of the Vagrantfile**: It includes settings for VM box, network, provider-specific configurations, and provisioning scripts.

### Configuring the Vagrantfile

- **Steps**: **Configure VM Box and Network Settings**:
- **Explanation**: In this step, you define the base box (the operating system image) and the network settings for your VM. This setup ensures your VM has the necessary resources and connectivity.

ruby

```

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.memory = "1024"
    vb.cpus = 2
  end
end

*# config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64" **(Vagrant Box name**)

# config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10" (**Assign VM static IP address for the VM)**
  #config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb| **(Hypervisor**)

 #config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
   # vb.memory = "1024" **(Assign RAM size of VM**)
    # vb.cpus = "2" **(Assign Number of CPUs of VM**)*

```

### Bringing Up the VM

- **Steps**: **Start the VM with Vagrant**:
- **Explanation**: The `vagrant up` command initializes and configures the VM based on the settings in the Vagrantfile. It automates the entire process, making it easy to set up consistent environments.

bash

```
vagrant up
```

**Verify the VM Status**:

- **Explanation**: The `vagrant status` command displays the current state of your VM, ensuring that it is running as expected.

bash

```
vagrant status
```

### Customizing and Accessing Your Virtual Machines

### 1. Accessing the VM

- **Steps**: **SSH into the VM**:
- **Explanation**: The `vagrant ssh` command provides secure shell access to your VM, allowing you to manage and configure it directly.

bash

```
vagrant ssh
```

### 2. Installing Apache HTTPD

- **Steps**: **Update Package List and Install Apache**:
- **Explanation**: Updating the package list ensures you have the latest software versions. Installing Apache sets up a web server on your VM, allowing you to serve web content.

bash

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apache2
```

**Verify Apache is Running**:

- **Explanation**: The `systemctl status` command checks the status of the Apache service, confirming that it is running and serving web requests.

bash

```
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

### 3. Creating a Custom Index Page

- **Steps**: **Create a Custom** `index.html` **File**:
- **Explanation**: Creating a custom `index.html` file allows you to customize the default Apache homepage. This step demonstrates your ability to serve custom content from your VM.

bash

```
echo "<h1>Welcome to my Vagrant website</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
```

### 4. Managing the VM with Vagrant Commands

- **Useful Commands**: **Halt the VM**:
- **Explanation**: The `vagrant halt` command gracefully shuts down the VM, preserving its state for the next time it is started.

bash

```
vagrant halt
```

**Destroy the VM**:

- **Explanation**: The `vagrant destroy` command removes the VM and all associated resources, freeing up system resources.

bash

```
vagrant destroy
```

**Provision the VM**:

- **Explanation**: The `vagrant provision` command re-applies the provisioning scripts defined in the Vagrantfile, ensuring the VM is configured correctly.

bash
